<p>Phishing: when someone or something tries to get personal information out of you with the use of email.

Flaming: hostile verbal acts over the internet to one another.

Spamming: usually there are many unwanted messages or emails in spamming that come in bulk sizes.

All three of these terms are alike and different in many ways. The first way is that they are all used online. Another is they can all be done in email. But the biggest reason to me why they are alike is that they are unwanted/ not needed. As in no one wants to have these things happen to them. They are different also, one uses email and the others can, but it may not be as specific. Phishing uses email, flaming and spamming do not have to use email. There also can be higher levels of hostile or unwanted attention for each of these. They basically have different reactions. Overall they are all very alike and different in many ways.
